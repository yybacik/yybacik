# Hi, I'm Yusuf Yigit

Project managment specialist at @tarvinaTech

## About Me

Hey! I'm Yusuf, a computer engineering student who gets excited about turning ideas into code. I love building things...

When I'm not buried in code, you'll probably find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or maybe just trying to figure out why my code works on my machine but not in production (story of my life 😅).

Feel free to check out my projects, reach out if you want to chat about tech, or just say hi! Always happy to connect with fellow developers.

💬 **Ask me about:** Really anything coding-related!
